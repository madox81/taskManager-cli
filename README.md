## taskManager CLI App

This is a small project for practicing **Python** with concentrating on some features like:
- Using print function with string format for design colors and position tasks data in a table.
- Using *list comprehension*.
- Using *type hinting*.
- Using *dataclasses*  Module for creating Task data object.
- Using *datetime* class and date formatting.
- Using [*docopt Module*](http://docopt.org/)  which let you describe command-line interface in 
  a human readable way then give you the ability to access those commands.
